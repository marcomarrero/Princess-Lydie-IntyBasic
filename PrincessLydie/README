This is Princess Lydie source code and object code.

It will NOT compile as-is, I did not include a tool I made that "multiplies" code from: mSnake0_A.bas to mSnake0_E.bas, and mSpinner0_B.bas.
The reason is that IntyBasic array handling is so slow, it's useless. I coded for one virtual enemy, and the tool duplicates for each of the 6 enemies.

The original code also had better background collision detection, but the CP1610 CPU is just too slow.

The code updates sprites in one frame, then background cards in the next one. Intellivision sprites are 1 frame behind. When running in easy mode in NTCS it's skipping 1 out of 6 frames and the sprite/card effect is very noticeable.

There is a separate tool to create data for levels, which is included in a different repository. I intentionally RLE compressed data, because I am already having problems due to the enormous code size.
